Google Data —>
Has 22 students (23 records) and 5 staff (5 records)
Has a duplicate student (same first + last name, different account address) and no duplicate staff
Has a student with almost same name, address is same except year
One student is left over from previous year

IC Data —> 
Has 25 students with 5 being new ‘students’ that will need accounts created for them
1 new student has almost same name as current student with same grade (twin)

Can expect—>
One new student should fail creating a new username since it would be a duplicate of an existing google username

Should find a duplicate student in the google accounts

google should have 2 unique (orphaned accounts) --> staff should be removed, previous year student should be ignored
ic should have 6 unique students  (1 is not unique but is an update to the account since it conflicts with an existing username)

One of the IC students has a random dash in name.  Should preserve formatting of name when setting up google accounts
