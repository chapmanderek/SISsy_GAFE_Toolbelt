Google Data —>
Has 20 students (21 records) and 5 staff (5 records)
Has a duplicate student (same first + last name, different account address) and no duplicate staff
Has a student with almost same name, address is same except year

IC Data —> 
Has 25 students with 5 being new ‘students’ that will need accounts created for them
1 new student has almost same name as current student with same grade (twin)

Can expect—>
One new student should fail creating a new username since it would be a duplicate of an existing google username
Should find a duplicate student in the google accounts

google should have none (staff should be removed)
ic should have 5 unique students
